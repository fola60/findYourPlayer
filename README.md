#### After specifying league and position, you will be taken to a page and shown categories based on the position you chose. By adding the points, shown on the right hand side, by clicking the + symbol, you can decide primarly what characteristics you want your player to have. For example, if all the points where added to the creative ability category, it would give you the player with the best creative ability, filtered by league and position you chose. If you want to find the best all round player, you can divide the points between the categories equally. All points must be used to proceed.
